**An Unsupervised and Probabilistic Quasar Continuum  Prediction Algorithm with Latent Factor Analysis**



Welcome! This is the source code for *Quasar Factor Analysis*. ðŸ˜‰

*Quasar Factor Analysis* (QFA) is an unsupervised and probalistic model for quasar spectrum modeling, which can be used for:

* Quasar continuum prediction 
  * High-accuracy and robust due to its unsupervsied nature
  * Reasonable uncertainty quantification
  * Flexible enough to deal with missing pixels
* Physically meaningful spectral embedding
  * One can decompose the quasar emission profile into a few components with exact physical meaning
* Out-of-distribution detection
  * Quasar spectra with interesting features can be selected via QFA thanks to its generative nature

For more details, we refer to
